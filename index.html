              <h3>Most Creative Design</h3>
              <p>Most Creative Design focuses more on implementation rather than idea (as in Most Creative Theme). Where the materials used creative? Any original methods used for creation of materials (solar oven for gingerbread, liquid nitrogen for icing)?</p>

                <p>To be considered for this award, please bring a baked cookie (or kit cookie) as to not destroy your gingerbread creation. Taste will be evaluated on texture, flavor, and originality.</p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>All gingerbread houses must be made in pairs of two. You may forfeit your right to a partner, but there will be no special consideration from the judges</li>
            <li>100% of materials for the gingerbread house must be edible, excluding the base or any parts that are used to control parts of the gingerbread house.  (ex. lights/candles or motors for moving parts of the house).</li>
            <li>Gingerbread and any other materials that require a stove or an oven must be made before the final construction. The idea is that you should bring a mostly assembled/ready gingerbread house to the atrium, and only final decorations are to be done onsite. Ofcourse, if you wish to show up before 5pm, you are allowed to.</li>
            <li>Kits are allowed, but not encouraged</li>
            <li>There is no limit on how early you start planning or start making the materials</li>
            <li>Rice krispy treats, pound cake, and other edible building materials are allowed, but should be limited such that the spirit of the gingerbread house competition is maintained.</li>
            <li>Height must be at least 15 cm tall</li>
            <li>Size must be such that it can be safely transported from place of assembly to place of competition. Time for final assembly exists.</li>
            <li>[Optional] Create a short description of your gingerbread house display for the judges</li>
            </ul>
